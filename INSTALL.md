### Downloading using Git

If you are a Git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio
```

The default branch is the most recent year of Visual Studio (2022) we support. If you need to use an older version like 2019, you will need to checkout that branch.

```shell
git checkout 2019
```

### Downloading manually

You can download the theme [from GitHub](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio/archive/2022.zip) or [Microsoft's official extension store](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.dracula).
