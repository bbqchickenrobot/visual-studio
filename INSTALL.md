Below you will see other download options, including different theme versions that support older versions of Visual Studio.

#### Downloading using Git

If you are a Git user, you can install the theme and keep up to date by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio
```

The default branch is the most recent year of Visual Studio (2022) we support. If you need to use an older version like 2019, you will need to check out that branch.

```shell
git checkout 2019
```

#### Known Issues

We know both C/C++ languages don't have the tokens to be coloured appropriately in the IDE. And they depend on packages and extensions in both VS and VSCode.

For context, this ðŸ¦‡ Dracula Theme for VS uses the VSCode theme as a base.

Any suggestions and contributions are welcome. âœ¨
